1	See, clearly you don't understand.  If god did it then clearly it can't be morally wrong.  That would violate the definition of wrong.  So if god kills someone, they deserve it.  Even if you know they did nothing wrong, the very act of god killing them means they deserve it.  To say otherwise would be to make a logical contradiction as god would be committing an immoral act.  Thus, god cannot commit immoral acts.

1	I worked as an aid for an after school program where I helped take care of 2-to-6 year olds almost every afternoon. One thing I continuously taught them was how they should try to poop as LITTLE as possible. It's better that they poop one big poop in a 48 hour period, than poop 4 small poops in 48 hours. I taught them to hold it in - why? Because simply put, pooping is DISGUSTING! It SMELLS bad, it LOOKS bad, and it SHOULD make you feel ashamed of yourself! It derides you morally, it's a most indecorous behavior. Now unfortunately we all need to poop, but it's best we do this act as little as possible throughout our lives. I would strongly suggest to anyone - ESPECIALLY children - not to poop more than 120 times a year. My personal goal was 97 poops in a year and I did it in 2005. I will continue to work with children and share with them the embarrassments of pooping - this should be even more understood by girls. No fairy tale prince wants to run off with a princess who poops - where's THAT children's book?!	abillionistoomany	WTF	-1	-1	0	2009-04	1240478497	"""I almost NEVER poop, pooping is DISGUSTING"""	c091u4l	8epf4

Except they have to go back in time to the 80s, where there are tons of better jokes to use than the lame 70s stuff this guy came up with. For example, you could set up Marty's parents as a knowing parody of a John Hughes movie: his Mom's dressing up like Molly Ringwald and his Dad's a pathetic loser spouting Ferris Bueller quotes. You could get in winks at all the great 80s teen movies from The Breakfast Club on down. The original Marty McFly laughed at his parents antiquated television set, but imagine a modern teen with no google and no cell phone. Replace the Reagan joke with a riff on the Terminatuh being the current governor of California and you're pretty much set. Marty's supposed to be a teen in high school which means he was born in the 90s -- so the time frame works too.	c09y2ev	8oixq

Of course there is the rare example of certain specialized fields but even then, the universities want kids to just accept certain opinions on how it is properly done instead of trying to advance a certain field or look for ways to improve on certain methods.

1	Very similar story - when I was around 6 or 7 years old I was living in Brasil. My parents had friends that owned a chacara a ways out of town, a nice place to relax on weekends. I was playing with a pocketknife (genius that I was) and managed to slit my left thumb to the bone. I ended up getting stitched up at some rural clinic halfway between Brasilia and Goiania, I still have clear memory of the doctor injecting painkiller directly into the open wound. I guess my point is that decades later I still have a scar on my left thumb, which I totally blame on those socialized medical pricks. American doctors would have grafted skin from my ass to make sure that my thumbs were pristine, now I have this fucked up scar thumbprint that makes it way easier to catch me when I commit crimes.

Being omniscient require meta-knowledge concerning what bits of knowledge fall into which sets. Some of those sets will belong to themselves, and things get nasty. Long story short, there is no complete set of all truths. That problem arises even after throwing out nonfactual knowledge, such as how to perform a triple back-flip with a full twist off of a diving board.

I was jogging on S. Congress and stopped to a walks pace before I see someone who I thought closely resembled him sitting in a booth at the window in the S. Congress Cafe (Across the street is a church that was in a scene in Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof). So I kept walking only to think I had run far enough, and when I started walking back towards the Cafe. At that moment, the door opened and him, Michelle Williams, and some other man came walking out and we began walking in stride all together. I had seen The Patriot twice, and Brokeback Mountain all in the theaters,  so at this point I knew who he was, and just stared at him. He kept his eyes on the ground, and only after it was obvious I was probably literally starstruck and surprised, he said, while pulling his long hair out of his face, ""Hey Man, what's up?""  I look at Michelle Williams whos eyes are wide and smiling at me, and then I look back at Heath and say ""YOU'RE GONNA KICK ASS AS THE JOKER"", and Michelle Williams and the other man laughed. At that point, I didn't want too appear bothersome so I ran off to continue my run. My impressions were that he was grungy, with tattoos on his forearm, but a handsome man.

Many anonymous people here will tell you to stand up for your ideals but then again, they don't have to live with your repercussions.   I don't feel it's worth breaking up a marriage over something as ridiculous as religion even though many take it seriously. However, for her peace of mind you can send your son and have him go through the CCD.  Knowing that you can instill the questions that those of faith refuse to ask themselves.  My son who is out of CCD and now heading to a catholic prep high school has the tools to ask questions and to doubt.  He read the god delusion and wants to read the Greatest show on earth next.

Four years ago I was happily working for a manufacturer in Kansas City, MO when I decided to elope with my then GF, who lived in Fresno, CA.  I had taken a couple days off and went out to visit her and we decided it was just time.  We had also decided I would be the one who moved because she had a stronger familial base and that would be better for the kids (my family is spread out all over the country).  So we went down to the courthouse and got hitched.  I had to go back to KC to pack up and I could have just left without notice, but I really liked the people I worked with so I decided to give two weeks.  Come the end of the two weeks I went in to the office manager's office to wrap up paperwork and she handed me my last check which had nearly $3000 too much in it.  I pointed out the overage and she replied that it amounted to all the sick days and vacation days I had accrued during my time there, plus a little extra.  They would not give them to people who didn't give notice and weren't obligated to give them to me now, but because of my character and the fact that I had given notice, the boss really wanted me to have them as a way of saying thanks for my time with them.

I am prepared for downvotes because the truth hurts. The Civil War was not fought to abolish slavery. Although it was a great occurrence because of the Civil War, it really didn't have much weight in the decision process of going to war. Slaves were owned by rich plantation owners, and the majority of people who fought for the South were poor farmers. The main reason the Civil War was fought was because of State's rights. The South feared a strong centralized Federal Government. The North wanted less State rights and more centralized government. It is thought that slavery would've been phased out naturally due to economic reasons than for legal reasons. Slaves were expensive; you had to feed, cloth, and house people year round. At this time seasonal workers were becoming more common. By the time of the Civil War, slaves were a status symbol for the rich. I am TOTALLY FOR the abolishment of slavery. I think slavery in any form is disgusting and has no place in any civilization, but we need to get our facts straight here.	c0nbog2	bl7ln

1	The kids reconciliation with their father is gone. They missed that opportunity when he died. Now they are just trying to re conciliate with their fathers money. How loving.	bigpappa	AskReddit	6	6	0	2010-05	1273618097	I agree with newsedition. OP is a different person with a different life to live, and has to make choices based on this. What is his relationship to these nieces/nephews? What kind of relationship does he want with these nieces/nephews? Was the dead brother not on speaking terms with his kids because that's what the kids truly wanted, and if they did want that, was it because they were teens/young adults when the relationship broke down? My father, influenced by his crazy wife (not my mother), cut me and one of my brothers out of his life for nearly 10 years. We weren't on speaking terms but that was because he wouldn't respond to our efforts at reconciliation. And in fact, my dad's brother took sides with my dad in a situation in which he had only my dad's version of the story. I didn't blame my uncle for his loyalty but I did see him as completely out of line in his conclusions and behavior. My dad's wife eventually died and my dad eventually got back in touch and is now loving and supportive. But it took TEN YEARS for him to come around, and the illness and eventual suicide of his wife, and a lot of maturing in his soul. And he had to be in control of the timing and the process when it did happen. I spent my 20s without my father. For some of the time, I was angry as hell at him: most of all for thinking he could sever a relationship that HE had created (when he was young and married to my mother). Then I got over it and I spent five years wishing only that we would reconcile before he died. I did NOT want him to die in such a state of internal strife and turmoil. I desperately wanted him to die knowing how much I loved and honored him, how sorry I was for what I had done to contribute to the chasm, and that he was forgiven entirely. I am so eternally grateful that we reconciled in fact, in time for him to be at my son's birth. I think this long view is necessary for the OP. These situations in families are rarely static. It is probable that eventually the brother and his children would have reconciled, had the brother lived longer. And I also think that it's very important to realize that the brother could not have been entirely innocent in whatever went wrong in these relationships. Regardless of the wife who cheated and turned the kids against him. It's impossible for anyone to be innocent in these situations. And a man who is that successful probably, along the way, sacrificed some things related to his kids' needs, and later reacted immaturely to whatever they did that upset him. So, really, the OP needs to think more deeply about his brother, and his brother's values, and come to a conclusion that IS about those kids' own reconciliation with their father.	c0ptc6o	c2lgk

1	please.  you're trying to bring logic into the conversation?  this is reddit!  this is America!  we all deserve a high standard of living don't we?!  isn't that in the Constitution or something?  how can those greedy evil bastard republicans/corporations turn a blind eye to the poor people in desperate need for just an aspirin or two?  so what if they smoked, drank and overate for 40 years, they deserve millions of dollars of hospital treatment because they are human too!  aren't all men created equal?  that means we should all get free healthcare!  I don't see why the greatest country in the history of the earth can't afford it!  I mean if Cuba can give free healthcare to all its citizens why can't America?  Can't doctors be happy making $100,000 a year?  Isn't that enough?  That's what they get in England and they are very happy with it!  If we could just get everyone together to pool our money and pay for everyone, that itself would bring down all the costs right?  Isn't that how it works in economics?  I've never taken an economics class but that's what I read on Huffpo so it must be true.  Yeah we'll all be okay as long as the Democrats are in charge.

The repercussions in court would be (depending on the state of course) capital murder, most likely with a death sentence. The law views the law enforcement officer as infalble and any effort to resist is obstruction of justice, resisting arrest or any other of numerous violations. The court's view is that you should obey and then work out what ever injustices are visted upon you in the court system. This discourages police from using common sense and good judgment when they can just foist that responsibility on someone else. Conversely, if everyone used the excuse that they were only defending themselves from unjust assault, it would be easy to kill a cop for just doing his job, and get away with it. I don't know what the answer is to this problem, but clearly police need reining in.	c127ao6	dqoie

Yes, I know the mocked Keynesian response to any insufficient recovery is that you didn't stimulate enough.  However, in this case, it's true.  Of the 850 billion stimulus, roughly 1/3 went to states to shore up their budgets.  This didn't increase any government spending at all, it just allowed the states to not make quite as many cuts as they might have otherwise.  Another 1/3 went into tax cuts, and the last 1/3 went into infrastructure projects, leaving the actual ""stimulative"" spending at closer to 500 billion.  In spite of the stimulus funding, states and municipalities have been cutting their spending left and right and increasing taxes to a degree that effectively offsets the rest of the federal stimulus.  Thus overall government spending wasn't really increased by any significant margin - the stimulus merely made the spending shift from the states and municipalities to the federal government."	c154uts	e40kk

Embraers (depending on on the carrier's individual build options) are particularly tail heavy:  larger aircraft can also have issues depending on anything from overfuelling (aircraft change after fuelled for different destination, pilots that don't trust dispatchers flight plan and bump up the fuel which then exceeds safe takeoff weights meaning passengers off) to balance issues where there is more/less baggage(or cargo) than what is needed to keep the plane in balance ( A321 with spare fuel tank needs significant weight in the aft to keep it in trim). Of course I'm not going into where there can be weather/mechanical issues that place further restrictions on a particular flight/aircraft type/route. If we are over legal weight by 1 kg we still have to remove that weight from the aircraft as silly as that may seem... the systems and regulations do not allow us to excede defined maximums - so clearly they ""busted"" that weight limit at the last minute. Taking passengers off was the fastest mitigation of the issue (as the alternative is removing baggage). TL - overbooking not the issue - weight issue was real."	c1aqm8r	et3pf

If something shows no medical benefits (again this will go either way depending which studies your quoting) then it can only be cosmetic (like cutting off a dogs tail/ear clipping).

This is my simple way of saying: That's the thing with politics, you can't nitpick factors and assume that that's that. The amount of knowledge each and every single one of us lack is so immense that I don't understand how some people can be so certain with their political arguments and proposals.
